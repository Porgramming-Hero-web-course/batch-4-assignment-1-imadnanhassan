#The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union and Intersection types are important features in TypeScript that help ensure type safety in your code.

\_\_Union types allow a variable to be one of several possible types, denoted by the "|" symbol.

example:
const userId: string | number;
userId = 'abc123';
userId = 456;

\_\_Intersection types allow a variable to be all of several possible types, denoted by the "&"
exmple:
const user: { name: string } & { age: number };
user = { name: 'Adnan', age: 26 };
